In order to find new treatments for COVID-19, scientists are probing how the coronavirus alters human cells when it infects and hijacks them. Most recently a research team at the Frankfurt University hospital announced theyve identified a number of compounds available in existing drugs including the metabolism-inhibiting cancer medication WP1122 that seem to stop the coronavirus from reproducing inside a host. The teams findings were published on May 14th in the journal Nature. Tap the link in our bio to read more about their research. #coronavirus",

Epic Games recently showed off a flashy tech demo titled \"Lumen in the Land of Nanite\" and claims Unreal Engine 5 could achieve photorealism on par with movie CG and real life. Of course, its easy to be taken in by a showy new demo. Back in 2016, we were wowed by a demo of Unreal Engine 4 that now looks well, not that impressive.

The hazard reports include details about the size and shape of the unidentified aerial phenomena. It's an interesting twist after decades of denial from the US government. To be clear, the Pentagon confirming authentic UFO videos doesn't necessarily mean we've found aliens, but it does mean that we don't really have an explanation for these flying objects in the footage, hence UFO. While unusual aircraft can't be ruled out, it's entirely possible the objects seen in Navy videos might be drones, although no nearby drone operators could be located.
