Until recently, the kindergartner was one of 1.2 million students in California who lack access to a device or the internet. Across the country, around 42 million Americans do not have access to broadband internetand 1 in 10 Americans have access to the internet only via their smartphones. Were going to see a widening of educational inequality that will last a long time and wont fade away, says a Harvard professor who studies how access to the internet affects inequality.

He agreed with some friends nearby to become part of their pod, quaranteam, or bubble. In some places, double-bubbling is becoming official policy: households are being encouraged to buddy up for the sake of variety and mental health. But negotiating to become part of someone elses intimate circle in the midst of a pandemic is fraught with dangers both medical (what if you inadvertently infect one another?) and social. (What if you have a falling out? Whom do you pick? What if they dont pick you?) Lichfield and his bubblemates have all been pretty strict in their precautions up to now, but everyone does things a little differently, and he's commented to other friends that agreeing to bubble up (or is it bubble down?) with people is like negotiating an open relationship: Whats allowed? What isnt? What do we need to communicate about? How do we resolve disagreements? Here are some suggested guidelines for how to have the conversation, based on nothing more than his own experience and that of his friends and colleagues.

(This has indeed been a problem.) She quickly created a prototype of a mask printed with a facenot your face, but rather unique faces of imaginary people generated using artificial intelligenceand posted her idea on Twitter: Protect people from viral epidemics while still being able to unlock your phone. _ The demand was immediate. Those interested in the idea include cancer patients who want to customize their masks, doctors who work in childrens hospitals and dont want to scare kidsand people in China.

It has made a name for itself producing consistently headline-grabbing research, alongside other AI heavyweights like Alphabets DeepMind. It is also a darling in Silicon Valley, counting Elon Musk and legendary investor Sam Altman among its founders. Above all, it is lionized for its mission. Its goal is to be the first to create AGIa machine with the learning and reasoning powers of a human mind. The purpose is not world domination; rather, the lab wants to ensure that the technology is developed safely and its benefits distributed evenly to the world. OpenAI wants to be the shepherd of artificial general intelligence, and it has carefully crafted its image to fit the bill. But three days at OpenAIs officeand nearly three dozen interviews with past and current employees, collaborators, friends, and other experts in the fieldsuggest a different picture. _ There is a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors. Over time, it has allowed a fierce competitiveness and mounting pressure for ever more funding to erode its founding ideals of transparency, openness, and collaboration. Many who work or worked for the company insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak or feared retaliation. Their accounts suggest that OpenAI, for all its noble aspirations, is obsessed with maintaining secrecy, protecting its image, and retaining the loyalty of its employees.

            "caption": "On Friday morning, Boeings CST-100 Starliner launched into space for the first time, but the uncrewed spacecraft failed to make it into a stable orbit that would allow it to rendezvous with the International Space Station. _ After Starliner separated from an Atlas V rocket, it believed it was in a different segment of the mission than it really was. Instead of executing an engine burn to get into its target orbit, Starliner ended up doing a different burn designed to maintain control and precision. The spacecraft burned too much fuel, which will make it too difficult for NASA and Boeing to attempt to dock with the ISS. _ Boeing and NASA still have no clue why Starliners timer was off, and thats something theyll be studying intensely over the next several days. Although they cannot test Starliners ability to dock safely with the ISS, they will still be ensuring that the spacecraft is functioning properly during its time in orbit, and determining what mission objectives can still be met with the remaining propellant on board. The plan for now is to return Starliner to Earth Sunday morning, to its original planned landing spot in the White Sands desert in New Mexico. _ This mission, though uncrewed, would have been a huge milestone for NASAs Commercial Crew Program, and an important step toward the resumption of human spaceflight launches from US soil. Any astronauts on board could have taken action to override the automation and get the spacecraft into its proper orbit, says NASA astronaut Nicole Mann, who is slated to fly aboard Starliner for its future crewed test flight. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine echoed those sentiments at a post-launch press conference Friday, telling reporters that had this been a crewed mission, our crew would have been safe.

The onslaught of fake news and the rampant disinformation campaigns now common on social media might make it seem as if we dumb humans dont investigate sources as deeply as we should. These studies indicate otherwise: technology isnt something we trust naturally, at least when were young. _ Kids are paying attention, says Judith Danovitch, a researcher at the University of Louisville and an author of one of the studies. Theyre keeping track of who knows what theyre talking about and who doesnt. Kids dont just blindly believe every answer they get.

At the checkout counter, a cashier tallies the total, but Bassam doesnt pay with cash or a credit card. Instead he lifts his head to a black box and gazes into the mirror and camera at its center. A moment later, an image of Bassams eye flashes on the cashiers screen. Bassam collects his receiptwhich reads EyePay and World Food Programme Building Blocks across the topand walks out into the noonday chaos of the Zaatari refugee camp. Though Bassam may not know it, his visit to the supermarket involves one of the first uses of blockchain for humanitarian aid. By letting a machine scan his iris, he confirmed his identity on a traditional United Nations database, queried a family account kept on a variant of the Ethereum blockchain by the World Food Programme (WFP), and settled his bill without opening his wallet. _ Click the link in our bio for a look inside the Jordan refugee camp that runs on blockchain. _ Photos from @rjuskalianphoto #WorldRefugeeDay",

But because he doesnt have legal documents for the property, he cant obtain electricity, a problem shared by many in Indias slums. That's where Selco, a Bangalore-based social enterprise, comes in. _ Selco has been supplying solar panels, batteries, and other tools to homes, farms, and businesses in rural villages. Through its foundation, the organization develops customized solar-powered tools for micro-entrepreneurs, including the blower that Ji uses to stoke his fire. The nonprofit has also created water pumps, photocopiers, and cattle-milking contraptions that run directly off solar panels and batteries, and its working on chili-powder pounders, banana-chip choppers, and puffed-rice puffers. _ Given India's sprawling scale and fragmented grids, decentralized renewable power will need to play a large role in electrification, says Pratim Raha, a program manager at the Selco Foundation. That, in turn, will also ensure that clean energy sources can account for as much as possible of the projected rise in energy consumption in the decades to come. _ If your narrative is The grid will come and solve all problems, thats not right in India, Raha says. _ Click the link in our bio to learn how India is now a shining case study in how rapidly generation of renewable power can expand with government investment and support, even in a deeply poor country, and how it also underscores the fact that adding clean energy and cutting climate emissions arent the same thing. _ Photos from @khandelwal_saumya #india",

No, not the Apollo 11 crew, but the crew of Apollo 9, Russell Schweickart, David Scott, and James McDivitt. These three men unveiled the lander to the press that they would test out and live in for 10 days in space, before the Apollo 11 crew would later take it to the moon. As Colonel McDivitt told the @nytimes, The purpose of the flight is to see if this whole gigantic mess would be able to fly to the moon and land there. The mission launched a few months later on March 3, 1969. _ This photo and caption is from The Airlock, our new free newsletter about emerging space technology. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, @erinwinick will also be following the 1969 journey to the moon one week at a time, and looking at how some of those accomplishments still affect the space program today.

In addition to the support of our awesome followers, this wouldn't be possible without all of the talented illustrators, animators, and photographers whose work you see on this page. Finding visuals to run with @technologyreview stories is often a challenge. Many of the topics that we coverlike quantum computing, CRISPR, and machine learningare things that operate at the microscopic or theoretical level. In other words, we write about topics you can't easily see with your own eyes. We couldn't do what we do without the creative, interpretive powers of the visual artists who we work with to help bring some of these complicated and abstract stories to life for our readers. So thanks for following along, reading our stories, and appreciating the art that goes with themonward to the next 100k!

Around the same time, she had been removed from teaching a class shed spent years co-developingMITs first coursewhen her male colleague took it over.

The hazard reports include details about the size and shape of the unidentified aerial phenomena. It's an interesting twist after decades of denial from the US government. To be clear, the Pentagon confirming authentic UFO videos doesn't necessarily mean we've found aliens, but it does mean that we don't really have an explanation for these flying objects in the footage, hence UFO. While unusual aircraft can't be ruled out, it's entirely possible the objects seen in Navy videos might be drones, although no nearby drone operators could be located.

Fusion power is a proposed form of generating electricity that works by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions. During the process two lighter atomic nuclei fuse together to make one heavier one, releasing energy as well. Most fusion reactors today use light elements in the form of plasma to generate power, but these can be incredibly hot, unpredictable, and difficult to control. That's why it's a pretty big deal that these Princeton researchers think they may have found a way to make fusion reactors more stable.

The corpse of a planet may seem like a strange place to look for signs of life, but that's exactly what researchers propose doing. It takes a special kind of Earth-like exoplanet. One orbiting a white dwarf. This particular brand of exoplanet would have survived the death of its host star: white dwarves are the remnant cores of stars that exhausted all of their fuel and collapsed. Needless to say, any life that was on such a planet when its star collapsed would most likely long be dead, but the theory is that new life could still have emerged afterward. The next step for researchers is to create a catalog of such star systems so that every astronomer can know what to look for. #astronomy",

It enters the endothelium, which is the defense line of the blood vessels. So it brings your own defense down and causes problems in microcirculation. The finding, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, could explain why patients with conditions that affect their blood vessels like high blood pressure, hypertension, and heart disease are in more danger from the COVID than the rest of the population.

In 2019, astronomers made an incredible discovery: a comet from a different star system making a close approach to the Sun at an extremely unusual trajectory, which was later named 2I/Borisov after the amateur astronomer who discovered it. Now, a new study by an international team of researchers led by NASA has revealed something highly unusual: gas emanating from the comet contained unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide up to 26 times higher than that of the average comet. The fact that they found any carbon monoxide isnt in itself unusual. Its one of the most commonly found molecules in space. But the extremely high concentration puzzled the researchers.

In a new study, a group of Harvard researchers argue that prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. After analyzing computer models of several scenarios, they concluded that lifting current restrictions too quickly or too early could end up delaying the epidemics peak and possibly make consequences even more dire down the line. But the researchers also noted that their models arent meant to be hard and fast rules and that a long-term isolation could have other damaging societal effects.

Don't worry, it's more simple than that. Essentially, a team of researchers at MITs Dream Lab are working on an open source wearable \"glove-like\" device that can track and interact with dreams in a number of ways including, hopefully, giving you the ability to control the content of your own dreams. No, seriously! The teams radical goal is to prove once and for all that dreams arent just meaningless gibberish but can be hacked, augmented, and swayed to our benefit. The glove-like device is called Dormio, and it's outfitted with a host of sensors that can detect which sleeping state the wearer is in.

A new 3D-rendered simulation by Finnish researchers shows exactly how aerosol particles travel in an indoor environment, like a grocery store, and how easily coronavirus can spread terrifyingly far in close quarters. Someone infected by the coronavirus, can cough and walk away, but then leave behind extremely small aerosol particles carrying the coronavirus, explained Aalto University assistant professor Ville Vuorinen in the statement about the research. These particles could then end up in the respiratory tract of others in the vicinity.

You could say it's a bit of mind reading, but not the kind you're used to from sci fi movies. The translation of thought to text works by collecting information from electrode arrays implanted in the brains of subjects. First, the scientists asked them to read sentences aloud while picking up their neural information, and then used that dataset to train an algorithm to understand what they were saying even when the subjects weren't reading aloud.

Knitting enthusiasts are hard at work filling a giant, gaping hole in the nations supply of face masks for healthcare workers. But despite the good intentions of the \"sewing army\" as the New York Times called them, the simple fact is that home-sown cloth masks are nearly useless in protecting against the virus and should only be a very last resort for practitioners in the field. So what are to do when medical professionals are in desperate need of protection? Donate money to your local hospital so they can afford to buy proper gear, leave the respirator masks at the store and dont hoard them for yourself to make sure that healthcare practitioners on the front lines have access to them instead. And above all, if you can: Stay. Inside. Tap the link in our bio to read more about what the CDC says about homemade masks.

By the middle of this century, maybe even as early as 2042, our world could be drastically redefined by this new device. So, here's how it works. Nanofabricators are like tiny factories, and at first, they'll be large like early computers were but soon enough youll be able to buy one that can fit on a desk. Youll pour in some raw materials perhaps water, air, dirt, and a few powders of rare elements if required and the nanofabricator will go to work, manipulating materials at the atomic level to create anything you'd like. It sounds like science fiction although, with the advent of 3D printers in recent years, less so than it used to. But we're close to making that fiction a reality.

Why? Let's unpack it a bit. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit South Korea, the country went into a state of full mobilization. While the country quickly developed tests and sent them out to nearly 300,000 of citizens over the past seven weeks, officials in the U.S. have still only issued about 60,000 tests. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly lied about the outbreak and downplayed the danger the new coronavirus posed. But South Koreas health agencies acted as soon as the virus emerged within the country.

The EHT image was able to catch the black holes photon sphere or photon ring, a region around a black hole where gravity is so overpowering, it forces photons to travel in orbits.

Jackson and her colleagues plan to enroll 45 adult volunteers to take doses of the potential vaccine over the course of six weeks, and evaluate whether or not the doses are safe and effective at inducing an immune response.

The cozy bed concept developed by Japanese company Bauhutte somehow has enough room for a dual monitor setup, oversized cupholders, a desk lamp, and even a retractable phone holder so you dont have to go through the pain of holding your phone with your hand. (Make sure you disinfect that phone first, too!) The coronavirus is no match for social distancing, and if this bed helps you avoid social contact for the next few weeks, all the better!

So, how far off are we? Musk has been closely supervising his space companys progress in constructing the first-ever functional prototype of the Starship, a 400-foot stainless steel rocket that could one day ferry up to 100 passengers to distant locales including the Moon and Mars. And his timeline for the Starship is ambitious: If all goes according to plan, he wants to establish a one million people-strong city on the Red Planet as soon as 2050 using a fleet of Starships. But despite progress towards those lofty goals, Musk still sounds pretty worried. Unless we improve our rate of innovation dramatically, then there is no chance of a base on the moon or a city on Mars, Musk said. This is my biggest concern.

But, according to theoretical research, two fully-entangled black holes should be able to transmit quantum information between them rather than destroying it like they usually would after it passes ones event horizon.

This might sound totally out there. (As far out there as, say, Mars! Sorry, bad joke.) But, as head of the influential Planetary Society, Nye's main priority is garnering funding for NASA's upcoming Mars rover mission which will attempt the first-ever feat of sending Martian rock samples back to Earth. And those little rocks will teach us a lot of important information about Mars. Tap the link in our bio to read more. #science",

An essay published last week in The Conversation argues: NASA needs to do more to prepare for crew members' human needs. Even the dirty ones. Astronauts may face undue psychological and mental strain due to space-enforced abstinence, which could potentially be solved by bringing high-tech sex toys on the space station (Claire Denis's \"High Life\" anyone?) or, even AI-enabled sex robots that could act out the role of a partner.

The bizarre-looking masks, printed with the smiling mug of the wearer underneath it, are the work of newly-launched design firm Resting Risk Face, which advertises its wares as trendy dystopian products.

The AI found 11 asteroids that were not previously classified by NASA as hazardous, and which were larger than 100 meters in diameter big enough to explode with the force of hundreds of nuclear weapons if they impacted Earth. But luckily, none of the 11 are an imminent threat: not only are their chances of ever hitting Earth astronomically slim, but they are making their flyby between the years 2131 and 2923 hundreds of years from now.

So, there are... many possible sources of these signals. But Avi Loeb, the chair of Harvard Universitys astronomy department, told Futurism this week that he thinks one possibility is that the signals are coming from an alien civilization. But Loeb also acknowledged that the signals (fast radio bursts, or FRBs) could be generated by young neutron stars called magnetars or by another, yet-undiscovered natural phenomenon.

Here's both anyway: There's not a cure for coronavirus, but encouragingly, doctors have found other medicine to help treat patients with the virus.

The treatment rapidly improved multiple patients conditions. One 70-year-old woman tested positive for the coronavirus for ten days straight, but was cleared 48 hours after doctors tried the experimental treatment. If more medical teams confirm that the drugs help, health officials could have a valuable new weapon in their arsenal against the global 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Each of these individual cells is about the size of the state of Texas. Tap the link in our bio to learn more about the scientific process that causes the patterns in the turbulent plasma. #science",

Officials in Australia confirmed the continents first case of 2019-nCoV, the pneumonia-like virus that emerged from Wuhan, China last month and by Monday, Australia had confirmed five total cases. And more could soon be confirmed: There are also suspected but yet-unconfirmed coronavirus cases in both Brazil and the Republic of Cte dIvoire. If those are confirmed, that would mean the viral pandemic has now spread to 6 out of 7 continents, after making its way to the U.S. and France last week. But before you scroll on, some context: Though the number of confirmed cases has tripled to nearly 2,900, about 2,840 of these cases remain within the borders of mainland China.

By studying the type of gravitational field that was produced by a ring laser, Mallett says, this could lead to a new way of looking at the possibility of a time machine based on a circulating beam of light.

Officials are baffled: Fleets of up to 17 drones, each with an estimated wingspan of six feet, had been spotted flying over Colorados Phillips and Yuma counties at night for more than a week. Since then, the sightings have expanded to six counties in Colorado and Nebraska, with as many as 30 drones spotted in the sky at once and, ominously, no one seems to know who they belong to.

YouTubes third-highest earner is Anastasia Radzinskaya, a five-year-old Russian with cerebral palsy and seven YouTube channels. An additional five of YouTubes top earners arent kids, but they are gamers who often showcase content popular with youngsters, such as Minecraft and Fortnite.

And what they discovered? You're a third more likely to develop chronic lung disease if you vape. Worse so, they found that the vast majority of e-cigarette users don't fully give up smoking cigarettes and using both forms of tobacco more than triples a person's risk of developing lung disease.

Here's the bad news: As jobs are automated out of existence, the division between the very wealthy and the very poor will grow and any notion of a comfortable middle class will vanish. This is all according to Roey Tzezana, a future studies researcher at Israels Tel Aviv University. But his prediction stands in contrast to the common argument that new jobs will emerge as others vanish, painting a grim picture for the workforce and global economy. As for the good news? Uh... there is none. But one prediction doesn't mean this terrible vision of society will come true. What do you all think about the future of the workforce? Will automation help workers become more efficient, or will it just replace us all together? Let us know in the comments and tap the link in our bio to read more. #automation",

If we want to prevent the rise of autonomous weapons like killer robots that can pull the trigger without needing a humans approval then engineers will actually need to stop working towards them. Sounds easy, right? It may sound like an obvious solution, but sometimes it's hard for researchers to predict how their work might get used or abused in the future. In theory, a weapon that puts human soldiers out of harm's way could be a great idea. At its worst? We've built an autonomous death machine that could go haywire at any moment.

A massive new study has linked frequent weed smoking to an increased risk of testicular cancer, but scientists say they'll need to conduct more specific research before they can definitively unravel the complicated health implications of marijuana. And to be fair, the kind of heavy use analyzed in the study is the equivalent of smoking a full joint every single day for a decade, so unless that sounds like you, odds are you dont need to panic.

Denning said the idea of building a colony to which humanity could escape if the Earth becomes uninhabitable is not only an unrealistic idea, but a dangerous one as well. \"How can we be enthusiastic about the human capacity to explore while maintaining our focus on what needs to happen here on this planet?\" Denning said.

Women have a number of options for contraception, from pills to implants to injections. But aside from condoms, men have just one: sterilization, which isnt always ideal given that it involves surgery and can be difficult to reverse. That could soon change, though, as researchers in India have completed testing on a male birth control injection and the only thing now standing in its way is regulatory approval.

The outrageous Blade Runner-style pickup truck, starting at a price of $39,900, is a pretty killer deal. But some are having a visceral reaction to its brutalist design. \"Seriously it's like a Delorean mated with a Pontiac Aztek,\" said Twitter user Tom Giles. The absolute unit of a truck is meant to be armored and fully bulletproof, but during Musk's big reveal, something went... a bit wrong, and the \"impenetrable\" truck's window shattered. But Musk is undeterred! He tweeted Friday that a future iteration of the electric pickup may even have solar panels to keep you going before the next recharge.

As Voyager 2 began its journey into interstellar space in late 2018, it recorded temperatures as high as 49,427 degrees Celsius (89,000 degrees Fahrenheit).

(They first identified it as a possible cause back in September.) While this is a big step in helping us understand what may be causing these injuries, these findings do not rule out the potential for other compounds or ingredients as contributing factors, said public health expert Scott Becker.

The offense? @lemonade_inc dared to use the pinkish color magenta in its ads in Germany, and Deutsche Telekom says it owns the legal rights to the shade. Lemonade tried to capitalize on the bizarre lawsuit with a social media movement but so far results seem mixed. The suit is becoming a fantastic spectacle, but also illustrates the extent to which megacorporations can use the legal system to snuff out perceived threats, regardless how frivolous and has striking similarities to the legal conflicts between vantablack, licensed to artist Anish Kapor and the pinkest pink developed by artist Stuart Semple. #futurism",

But in November, a company called Genomic Prediction claimed to have developed a method for \"scanning\" embryos for their intelligence through genetic testing and assigning them a \"polygenic score.\" If it was accurate, it would allow parents to pick and chose only the embryos with super smart \"scores\" but it turns out the accuracy of the tech may have been debunked.

It's an incredible accomplishment, but some of you may be wondering: Why should I care? And what is quantum supremacy in the first place? Lets take a couple steps back. In a recent paper, a team of Google AI scientists claimed their quantum computer called Sycamore was capable of completing a task involving the verification of the randomness of large numbers in just three minutes and twenty seconds. The most powerful supercomputer in the world, they said, would need 10,000 years to accomplish the same task.

Here's what we know so far: - The damage vaping causes to the lungs resembles a toxic poison or a chemical burn, according to doctors from the Mayo Clinic. Some vapes were even found to contain cyanide. - Black market cartridges can be very dangerous to vapers, but it's not just unregulated THC that's causing \"vape lung.\" A study published Monday found that vaping nicotine caused lung cancer in mice a worrying look at the future health impact nicotine vapers will face, and an argument for more research on humans.

This is a question scientists are asking themselves as technology like CRISPR continues to push the boundaries of biological ethics including the potential to hack new traits into animals that could enhance their intelligence. In March, scientists altered monkey brains to be more humanlike, seeing an immediate boost in the animals memory and cognitive skills. While doing so is still impossible, the developments raise the question of whether humanity could someday, far in the future, make animals as smart as humans.

He has a genetic condition with no name and no cure but he wants to use CRISPR gene-hacking technology to find a solution. What Vohryzek wants is to insert an entirely new gene into his DNA which is likely beyond the scope of current gene-hacking technology. The radical tech still has many unknowns, and requires more research before medical professionals will sign off on it so Vohryzek is volunteering to become a CRISPR guinea pig. \"If I die because of an experimental treatment, it will at least help science,\" he said.

Gruesome new research has revealed that corpses actually thrash around for about a year after we die. You might be imagining a graveyard full of dancing zombies but the movement is really more subtle. As bodies decompose, they tend to slowly-but-surely writhe around as the body mummifies and the ligaments dry out. To catch a glimpse of the corpse wiggling, a team of Australian scientists photographed a mans corpse every half hour for 17 months, according to the research published last month in a new journal called Forensic Science International: Synergy. The bodys arms started down along its sides, but ended up outstretched a troubling find that could also have far-reaching implications for forensic investigators.

A team of researchers from the Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the Universit de Montral have detected water vapor and maybe even rain in the atmosphere of an exoplanet that's located in its star's habitable zone. Detecting liquid water on exoplanets suggests that they could harbor life and the more water worlds we spot, the closer we get to confirming that were not alone in the universe. The planet, named K2-18b and discovered by NASAs Keplers space telescope in 2015, is as far away from its star as Earth is from the Sun meaning it receives a similar amount of energy. Scientists dont know if life would be able to survive on K2-18b, but theyre hailing the discovery as a breakthrough. Tap the link in our bio to read this and more on The Byte. #space",

So heres a simple how-to on how to construct a traversable cosmic wormhole that could send your spaceship to the furthest reaches of space: take two charged black holes, place them back to back, and thread two cosmic strings through both. Stretch both strings to infinity and presto! Youve got yourself a traversable wormhole. Confused yet? A team of astrophysicists dreamed up this solution, which could technically send travelers to a distant corner of the universe, in a preprint paper on arXiv earlier this month and Ohio State University astrophysicist Paul Sutter published a terrific breakdown of the concept.

Its a bold claim, but University of California physicist James Scargill did the work to back it up, sharing his theory in a new paper that upends many assumptions about the requirements for life as we know it.

An investigation has has revealed several major problems with the US military's F-35 fighter jet including spikes in cabin pressure that cause pilots to experience severe ear and sinus pain. Some pilots also cant fully control the aircrafts pitch, roll, and yaw after completing certain maneuvers and in some conditions, the aircrafts night vision camera displays green horizontal lines that make it difficult for pilots to see the horizon. The F-35 is supposed to play a major role in the future of the U.S. military but the trillion-dollar program may be in even worse shape than the public knows.

Now, a team of astronomers from the U.S. and Europe determined which planets are most likely to survive the deaths of the white dwarf stars they orbit, according to new research. Small, dense, and distant exoplanets have the best odds, which could help astronomers pinpoint even more planets in the remote cosmos. Tap the link in our bio to read more. #space",

On Wednesday, an international coalition of scientists that came together to form the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) more on that later announced via livestream that they had captured direct images of a supermassive black hole in the M87 galaxy. These images signify that scientists have finally seen, first hand, celestial bodies that up until recently were only assumed to exist. Because the light observed by the EHT has warped around the black hole before traveling to Earth, the shadow we see is actually the entire surface of the black hole, as though it had been ripped open and flattened like a pancake, surrounded by a disk of orbiting light.

Soon, in a strange twist, self-driving cars could exacerbate the problem by reducing the number of car accidents, which is currently one of the primary sources of donor organs. Researchers across the globe are hunting for ways to save patients. And now, an idea previously relegated to the realm of science fiction is starting to look like a viable option: transplanting organs from animals into humans.

Fleming trained a generation of all-women human \"computers\" at Harvard College Observatory and recorded observations of thousands of stars using a system she devised. She is credited with discovering 310+ stars, 10 novae, and 10 nebulae, including the Horsehead Nebula. Much of Fleming's work was credited to her male colleagues at the time but, thankfully, is recognized today. In 1906, Fleming was made an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society of London, the first American woman to receive the honor.",
