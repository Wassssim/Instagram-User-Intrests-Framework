Facebook has announced changes to how it handles and communicates violations of its policies around the publishing of fake news and misinformation, with the goal of preventing publishers that operate large networks of pages and groups from skirting bans. . Starting today, Facebook says it will reserve the right to take down existing pages and groups that are simply affiliated with those that have violated the companys community standards, even if those pages or groups havent technically broken any rules. . Facebook says this is specifically to prevent users from using an adjacent or other existing page or group as a replacement once another has been flagged and taken down. Prior to this change, the page or group must have been made after the initial removal to be potentially affected simply for affiliation reasons. Now, Facebook says it can use this policy to pull down an affiliated page or group even if it was made before the takedown. . While it appears the change is focused on preventing people from continuing to peddle fake or purposefully inflammatory content, it also applies to violations of Facebooks rules on spam and clickbait, copyright-infringing material, hate speech, graphic violence, harassment and bullying, and nudity. . Not all inaccurate or inflammatory content counts as a violation, but the company now points to its extensive community standards page to help clarify how it makes these distinctions. .

Google Hangouts is getting shut down, and would be replaced by a much nicer-looking Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet. The switch to the new platform is set to take place this October, retiring the classic Hangouts app for the new apps. However the death of classic Hangouts wouldnt come until 2020
The glow-up challenge, as many dubbed it, revealed how so much fun Facebook used to be. The challenge asks people to post a photo of one of their throwbacks from as far back as 10 years, and share alongside their most current one. It was quite endearing and fun, especially for those between ages 24 and 29, springing forth interestingly adorable universal awkwardness. . One of the participants said, Digging through my Facebook photos was like diving into a treasure trove of happy memories I wouldnt dream of posting today. . There was no thinking beyond, many from around the world joined in the fun, with the whole internet buzzing with the hashtags #GlowUpChallenge and #10YearsChallenge, bringing back nostalgic memories and comic relief seeing updates from friends. . What are your thoughts on the viral challenge? Were you able to participate?
The picture of an egg has surpassed Kylie Jenners birth announcement photo, as the new record holder for the most-liked photo ever on Instagram. The photo which was originally posted on the January 4, by @World_record_egg, seems to have cracked the viral formula, amassing over 25 million likes win a few days. . In response to the short video, Kylie Jenner shared a short video of her cracking an egg on the ground, with caption Take that little egg.
Google is rolling out its first monthly update in 2019 for its flagship Android devices. The only listed change is a bug fix addressing an audio quality issue on both models of the Pixel 3 thatoccurs while recording video, as reported by users on Reddit. . Meanwhile, the Pixel 2 / 2 XL, Pixel / XL, and Pixel C are also receiving January updates to patch security vulnerabilities and generally just keep up shop. I received the update late last night on a Pixel 3XL unit that was having some stability issues, applied the update, and was greeted by a smoother experience, complete with the audio quality fixes. . Notably exempt from this months update are Googles older Nexus 5X and 6P phones,which have reached the end of Googles three-year commitmentto provide device security updates. . As for availability, the free January update is rolling out to Pixel users throughout today.

Samsung at CES 2019 announced the Notebook Odyssey, the most powerful Samsung gaming laptop yet and the biggest sign that the company is starting to take PC gaming more seriously. . Its not that Samsung hasnt been making gaming laptops already the companys Odyssey linehas been around for a while  but the new Notebook Odyssey takes that foundation and goes further. It has the kinds of specifications that should (at least on paper) let it compete with more established gaming companies like Asus, Dell, or even Razer. . Spec-wise, Samsung is bumping things up to Nvidias newly announced, top-of-the-line RTX 2080 GPU, along with an 8th Gen hexacore Intel Core i7 processor (Samsung isnt saying which one yet, although its probably the i7-8850H) and 16GB of RAM. The display is a 1080p, 15.6-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. Storage is a 256GB NVMe SSD and a 1TB HDD, although those will be user-replaceable should you need more space. Theres also a USB-C port this time, in addition to three USB-A ports and an HDMI jack.

Five years after Facebook Messenger took a cue from WhatsApp to launch voice messaging,Instagram has rolled out its own voice messaging feature globally on Instagram Direct today. . Users can hold down the microphone button to record a short voice message that appears in the chat as an audio wave form that recipients can then listen to at their leisure. . Voice messages are up to one-minute long, stay permanently listenable rather than disappearing and work in one-on-one and group chats on iOS and Android. The feature offers an off-camera asynchronous alternative to thevideo calling feature Instagram releasedin June. . Share your thoughts on this new feature below 
YouTube is expanding its Instagram-like Stories capability to more creators today, giving those with more than 10,000 subscribers the chance to use the tool.  There are some major differences between Instagram Stories and YouTubes iteration of the feature. YouTube Stories last for seven days on the mobile app, they will appear for both subscribers and non-subscribers, and theyll show up in YouTubes Up Next sidebar beside a video. Creators who use the tool will be able to respond to fans who interact with their stories, and creator responses will be seen by anyone who comes across the story. Fans can leave comments or questions on stories, and creators can publicly address each response.
For the most part, these are all features that other smartwatches share. What the Fossil Sport has going for it is that its one of the first Wear OS smartwatches to debut with Qualcomms new wearable chip, which is supposed to offer better battery life.And, as we know all too well, Googles Wear OS and its hardware partners suffered from low-power, outdated chipsets. . Fossil will start selling the Sport Smartwatch for $255 today online and directly at Fossil retail locations. . . Source: TheVerge
The Pinterest friend feature was firstlaunched back in March. The friends feature is a dedicated section of the service where you could follow posts from other users. Now, this feed is getting a redesign, removing the tiled images in favor of a simpler single column of posts, Instagram-style. There are even horizontal rows of Pinterest-recommended accounts that you can follow. . Aside from the change in layout, the chronological feed still works more or less the same way as it did before. You can tap on a red Save button below an image to save it to a board, or tap on the image directly to be linked out to a piece of content
Facebook Inc will finally release its two Video Chat devices  the Portal and the Portal Plus today and theyll be sold on platforms like Best Buy and Amazon. Since the devices are exclusive video chatting tools, their scope of abilities is quite limited. . Although the devices can play music, display photos and access some video platforms, its features are extremely small  they cant even access Facebook or surf the net. They can, however chat over the Facebook Messenger. . Since they are exclusive Facebook Video calling devices, they have inbuilt camera tricks to make video calls easier. Both the Portal and Portal Plus have single, fixed cameras on top of them. These cameras have the ability to zoom and follow you around, making it possibly for users to move around while engaging in a video call. . Source: @TechGistAfrica
On Thursday, it looked as though Google was starting to roll out a redesigned version of its vital Android Messages app. The update featured some visual changes like getting rid of the blue bar at the top and switching over to the companys Google Sans font. It also included a dark mode as an alternative to the default, so-much-white look. . But late last night, as Reddit users were quick to notice, Google reverted to the old Android Messages design  even for those who had already installed the most recent update. If you had the new Messages yesterday, open it up today and youll see that its gone. Yes, Google has the server-side ability to change the look of Messages on a dime. . Some users had complained about losing the option to assign custom colors to chat bubbles for their different contacts, but its rather unlikely that Google would reverse course over that bit of feedback alone. Perhaps dark mode was causing some issues, or there was another bug the company discovered, or the revamped Messages started appearing before Google actually intended. . Oh well. It looked good. Hopefully it returns soon. . . Source: The Verge Photo Credit: The Verge
Facebook has secured the rights to broadcast UEFA matches in much of Latin America, the association said yesterday. This can give Latin American soccer fans the chance to tune into their favorite sport without the need to pay to watch on their local TV station. . The contract includes a free live stream of both the organizations Champions League and Super Cup matches, adding up to 32 matches per season. A ton of Latin Americas top players take part in these leagues every year, making this partnership a big deal for many soccer fans. . ITS THE LATEST IN FACEBOOKS ATTEMPT TO TACKLE THE LIVE SPORTS STREAMING MARKET Its the latest in Facebooks attempt to tackle the live sports streaming market, including its move in January to hire Peter Hutton, then the CEO of the TV network Eurosport. Facebooks tapped similar deals for other sports in the past  its scored deals with other large sports orgs, like the NBA. But its still unclear if deals like these give the platform an edge over other social networks like Twitter, which secured its own MLB deal earlier this year, or streaming services like YouTube. . Facebooks EUFA contract will run from 2018 to 2021, and is limited to Spanish-speaking countries. . Source: The Verge. . : techviral.net
People managing Facebook pages with large American followings will now need to take extra steps to verify their identity, according to an announcement made by the company today. . Now, if these managers want to continue to post on their pages, theyll need to complete an authorization process that includes enabling two-factor authentication and confirming what country theyre based in. . If a page manager needs to authorize their account, theyll get a notice at the top of their newsfeed later this month, Facebook says. They wont be able to post on their page until they completely this process. This information will be added into a forthcoming site section called People Who Manage This Page, which will list which countries these pages are being managing from. . While this will initially appear on pages with a large US audience, it appears that Facebook will eventually be rolling out this feature across all pages. . "Facebooks rolling out these changes as it grapples with its role in the media" . Source - The Verge
Google is warning Android users that it doesnt carry Fortnite Battle Royale in the Play Store. If you search for Fortnite in the Play Store, it will return a notice from Google. Fortnite Battle Royal by Epic Games, Inc is not available on Google Play, the sign says, likely as a clarification to users, as first spotted by 9to5Google. . By saying upfront that the Play Store doesnt have Fortnite, Google is attempting to protect unknowing users who might download some malicious clone of the app. . Epic Games requires users who want to run Fortnite on Android to download an APK of the beta directly from its site. The decision essentially cuts Google out of potential revenue from app purchases, which would have been a 30 percent cut. . Android settings also usually dissuade users from downloading apps from unknown sources, likely as another safety mechanism and a way to maintain the importance of the Play Store as the main source for apps. . .

Spotify is testing a new feature in Australia thatll let non-paying users skip ads (both audio and video) as many times as they like. The company tells AdAge that the idea is that users will likely only skip ads they dont care about, so what they do consume will give Spotify feedback on how to better target them. A company executive compared it to Discover Weekly, but for ads. Advertisers wont have to pay for skipped ads. . I sort of understand this, but I dont know how much better it will make ads. People are lazy and dont want to have to navigate back to the app just to skip an ad. Spotify says its only testing the feature for now, but the goal is to launch it globally. . As someone who pays for Spotify, this makes me feel a little dumb! I only pay so that I never have to hear ads (and for offline downloads), but skippable ads seem easier to tolerate. It takes a bit of work to avoid them, but it might be worth the effort just to save some cash. . . Source: The Verge
Everyone seems to look perfect on Snapchat. That's thanks to a vast array of filters and editing options that can change our real-life appearance in an instant. . But obsessively tinkering with how we look on social media can have damaging effects. Doctors have coined a new term, "Snapchat dysmorphia," to describe the psychology of patients who seek cosmetic surgery procedures to look more like the filtered versions of themselves. . While no one is asking for surgically attached Pokemon Pikachu ears, patients are requesting fuller lips, bigger eyes and thinner noses to look more like the altered versions of themselves that appear on apps like Snapchat and Facetune, according to a new article published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery. . "This is an alarming trend because those filtered selfies often present an unattainable look and are blurring the line of reality and fantasy for these patients," say the piece written by doctors from Boston University School of Medicine's Department of Dermatology. .

Black Panther's claws keep making cash. . Disney said Black Panther is expected to clear $700 million in US box office receipts on Sunday, making the Marvel movie the third to hit this milestone after 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens and 2009's Avatar, according to Box Office Mojo. . The film's continued screening in US theaters is an accomplishment as it stands because the movie was released in February. . Disney added the superhero movie, which stars Chadwick Boseman, has made $646.7 million internationally bringing the combined total to more than $1.3 billion made so far. Black Panther is the second-most successful film of the year behind Avengers: Infinity War, which has made over $2 billion so far, according to Box Office Mojo. . Source: CNET
Hi August, you look promising. . How about we make the most of the time we have together?
Now your friends can see exactly how much time you spend lurking on Instagram. . Instagram announced Thursday the rollout of a new feature that will let your followers see when you're using the app. The concept is similar to Facebook Messenger: when someone you follow or have previously messaged with, is "active" in the app, Instagram will show a small green bubble next to their name to let you know that they're online. . "This update gives you the ability to have more of those realtime conversations while giving you the control to hide your status altogether," the company wrote in a blog post. . Source: Mashable
If the goal for a business is to reach customers where they are, a social media presence seems necessary. For a small business, engaging with consumers on at least one social media platform, offers an opportunity to promote your goods or services without a large monetary investment via traditional marketing channels. However, that same presence can be the source of other conflicts, if not managed properly. . Source: smallbusiness.chron.com
WhatsApp is considering curbing the amount of times you can forward messages to multiple chats, citing privacy concerns. The Facebook-owned app will begin a test that places a limit on message forwarding, it announced today. . Beyond the reasons WhatsApp listed, there are safety concerns involved for the spread of misinformation on the platform. The test comes after a series of violent mob lynchings in India were instigated by false messages about child abductions that were sent through WhatsApp. .

Facebook is continuing its initiative to develop hardware that beams down high-speed internet, though its moving the effort to space. . According to documents obtained by Wired through Freedom of Information Act requests, the social network is working on an internet satellite that would efficiently provide broadband access to unserved and underserved areas throughout the world, according to an application filed with the FCC under the name PointView Tech LLC. . Facebook has confirmed to Wired that it is indeed the company behind the application, and thtat the working title for the satellite is Athena. . Source: TheVerge

You are a giver. You go out of your way to serve others.  Truth is...people will let you down. They may not mean to, but it still happens.  Bigger question is...how do you deal with the instances where you are constantly let down by people who are takers?  Sometimes, you have to walk away. Sometimes, you have to stop crossing oceans and compromising your well being for those that will not jump a puddle for you.
Some guardian angels have fur instead of wings! Can I get an AMEN?! 
If something in your past is broken, that doesn't mean you can't make a colorful future. Your future is FULL of possibilities. Go after them with all you've got!
Happy International Womens Day! Tag someone who has made a difference in your life!
It's all about perspective. You either see the setback or the potential.
Have you ever heard the phrase, "Someone in the cheap seats does not get an opinion in your life"? Every time you stop twinkling to please others, you are not living up to your potential. You are not letting the light within you shine.  You are full of possibilities. The world needs you to shine your light. More importantly, you need to show up and shine for you.

Successful people never say Im too stupid... or Im not smart enough.... If they dont know something, they figure out how to get that knowledge. Successful people invest in knowledge - they invest in whatever is going them to the next level. Find a person who is demonstrating what you want to know in their business and learn from them. Dont let a stumbling block be a stopping block.

Wants some tips for growing your Instagram account? . 1.) Be consistent. People will start to expect posts every day if you start posting every day. Dont let them down! . 2.) Comment and like other peoples photos. Be a giver! Leave genuine comments on photos and respond when people comment on yours. . 3.) Use hashtags! These are searchable so use relevant ones to your post to get noticed. . 4.) Stay true to your brand. If you own a restaurant and only post about the restaurant, dont randomly throw in a post about a puppy. Im sure its cute, but it sends mixed messages to your followers. .

Strolling through the mall this weekend with my mother we encountered #BlackGirlMagic and #BlackChildEntrepreneurship as @chefjaviascents approached us with soy candle wax melts that she made herself. -  JAvia is a 10 year old child entrepreneur whos owns a natural fragrance business sparked by her love of chemistry and creating concoctions. -  I was AMAZED and so encouraged by her business etiquette and acumen. Her knowledge of her customer base, market reach and brand expansion was on par with most adult entrepreneurs. Chef JAvia is currently located at a kiosk in Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, NC while seeking to expand into a storefront in the same mall (see her IG for GoFundMe details). She has a website where purchases can be made. I strongly suggest the #BlackGirlMagic Room Spray, and candlewax/candles in Deadly Weapon  4 Leaf Clover  Give Me Life. -  Swipe to hear snippets of my conversation with JAvia today. Support this young entrepreneur with a #purchase and #share.  #BlackExcellence #SheDidThat #SheGotMyLunchMoneyForTheWeek #MoneyWellSpent #UrbanMentor  @euniquejg @becauseofthem @kidfury @thisistheread @shedidthatfilm @webuyblack @blackwall.st @blackgirlsrock

FIND OUR MISSING GIRLS THE SAME WAY THE FBI FOUND A MISSING, SWEATY FOOTBALL JERSEY! Whether they have been abducted, kidnapped or are actual runaways, the conversation should be HOW are we going to find them and WHAT will we do to protect our Village?! The follow-up conversations should be WHAT circumstances trigger the runaways or the enticement to what bait is being used to allure our youth? HOW  do we equip our youth to find answers and resources from trusted sources in our communities?!   Those that are actually running away are fleeing a multiplicity of issues but have no safe haven to turn to. With media and entertainment praising the stripper turn Instagram boutique mogul/model to celebrity baby mother pipeline, sadly some of these girls are willing to take that risk just to escape whatever they're presently in.   In the heightened concern for this travesty, let us not forget to ponder what is on the table for these predators that's driving this sick epidemic? They're not doing this for sole perversion, someone or something is pulling the puppet strings.   Connect with your local organizations and/or youth ministries and figure out how we can restore our community of villagers who collectively raised us. Let's push beyond our immediate comfort and be bold, courageous and selfless enough to invest in the life (lives) of those coming behind us. It just takes ONE to #BeTheDifference.  #BeTheDifference #ItOnlyTakesOne #Mentorship #UrbanMentorship #Mentor #YouthLeader #Youth #DCYouth #ProtectBlackYouth #FindOurGirls #NationalCrisis #BlackLivesMatter #TheSocialAgencyLLC #TSALLC

Did you know you can order any steakburger as a lettuce wrap?! We're still here for you in the drive-thru! #lettucewrap : @ohhappyketo
As our nation and the world rally to slow the spread of COVID-19, Freddys remains committed to the health and well-being of our Team Members and Guests. Beginning Wednesday, March 18, we will close our dining rooms at corporate-owned locations, focusing all Team Member activity on the quality, accuracy, and speed of our drive-thru, to serve you The Freddys Way. Our two corporate locations without drive-thru service will offer carry-out service only.  While understanding the needs of their local communities, a large number of our franchisees and operators have already chosen to follow the guidance of the CDC and local health officials by closing their dining areas, and we encourage all franchisees to adopt similar operational procedures at this time. Please be patient with our teams as they manage through these unique times. Hours may fluctuate and delivery remains available in select areas, so please check with your local Freddys to confirm todays hours of operation.
